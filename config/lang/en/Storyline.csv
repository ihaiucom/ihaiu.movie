100101		There you are, ready to open your film studio? Today is the big day.	Tracy
100102	A producer you worked with several times during your acting career. Tired of the film industry, she decided to join you when you raised the idea of changing the rules of the movie business.		Tracy
100103		Sure, let's get to work!	{name}
100201		But we aren't going to be able to pay for everything out of our pockets. We need an investor.	Tracy
100202		I've already thought of that. There are already several interested investors who are ready to support us!	{name}
100203		This should be enough to get things started. I've also convinced one of my actor friends to join us, guess who it is?	{name}
100401		Now that we have some capital and a star, it is time to start building!	Tracy
100501		The United Movie Association has given us a fund as support to help us on our artistic journey.	Tracy
100502		Good, we can put it to use for our first movie!	{name}
100601		They all sound really interesting…Makes it hard to choose only one.	{name}
100602		Different screenplays attract different audiences. We have to look at what the market likes before we make a decision.	Tracy
100603		I see, but we don't have our own Marketing Department yet, guess we'll have to go by feel for now.	{name}
100701		Hold on, this screenplay requires 2 characters but we only got one actor for now. Should we find an extra to play the role?	Tracy
100702		No, the first movie is too important. We can't risk lowering its quality by using extras. Don't worry, I already have a plan.	{name}
100703		I suspected this would be a good script when you sent it over, but I'm surprised by how good it was. I'm in!	Rock Jones
100801		Rock's leaving? But I thought you convinced him to join us.	Tracy
100802		Sadly, he's still under contract somewhere else, but he promised to return once we have more buzz and have completed more tasks!	{name}
100803	A famous actor, also a good friend of yours. He starred in your first movie, but needs to return to his other films due to signed contracts. You can sign him to your studio once you complete all main tasks!		Rock Jones
100901		We're finally going to sign another actor! I wonder what kind of person it will be?	{actor}
101001		You're used to being the star, but now that you're the producer you need to get your hands dirty with really marketing a movie properly.	Tracy
101002		Yeah, you're right. Though back then I didn't notice how it all goes. What should we do next?	{name}
101003		We need to spread the word about our film, block by block!	Tracy
101101		As the company keeps growing, we can't be expected to do everything ourselves. Hiring a secretary would allow us to get more work done.	Tracy
101201		The roadshow was a success! The fans loved it and have actually started a club. We will now keep earning more and more fans!	Tracy
101301		Some quality movies will receive great reviews, but then lose out at the box office. Some bad movies can also find an audience to buy enough tickets. This is really confusing.	Tracy
101302		That's the beauty of show business! We can't predict how the box office will turn out, but we can focus on making the best possible film.	{name}
101303		Well said. Let's make the best movie we can and hope the audience is into it!	Tracy
101401		You really think this is going to end well for you? How naive...	Kevin
101501		Now that we've grown so much, I find myself a bit overwhelmed. There is too much work and it's starting to feel like things are slipping. How can I solve this?	{name}
101502		Try making plans for your daily tasks more clearly. This will help you get a better grasp of what is going on with the company.	Tracy
101503		You're right! I just wish my planning skills were as good as my acting.	{name}
101504		I'll keep giving you some help, but you really need to start handling this on our own. The schedule is getting crazier.	Tracy
101505		Sounds good, oh and before I forget! Rock's contract has expired, so he's now free to sign with us!	{name}
101601		This is the third city where we've performed a roadshow. We're doing pretty well, aren't we?	{name}
101602		The road to success never stops, but you can take pride in what we have achieved so far!	Tracy
101603		That's the spirit! This attitude is why I decided to join you guys in the first place. Now let's keep making some great movies!	Rock Jones
101701		Strange...Our roadshow is a success, but the amount of audience is much less than before.	{name}
101702		Yeah, I noticed. And they seemed distracted too. Is there something wrong with our advertising strategy?	Tracy
101703		This is worrying...We need to find out the reason.	{name}
101801		How's your mission going?	Kevin
101802	CEO of Megastar Films, and your former boss.He controls the city's movie industry. Cold and ruthless, he will do anything to achieve his goals. He's currently upset about you, perhaps not only because of your retirement announcement.		Kevin
101803		As planned, Mr.Kevin. They're probably still wondering what's going on here.	Janine
101804	Kevin's secretary, a highly capable and beautiful woman. She seems pretty interested in your intense relationship with Kevin, and will even push things further in her own ways.		Janine
101901		This roadshow is the same with last one. At least one thing is clear, it cannot be an accident. Got any clue about it?	{name}
101902		Well, we don't have proof yet, but I'm pretty sure Megastar Films are behind this.	Tracy
101903		Megastar Films? I see...	{name}
102001		They still didn't make any moves. Do you think {name} just gave up?	Janine
102002		If so, I'm totally wasting my time on them then.	Kevin
102003		Sounds like you are expecting them to fight back, Mr.Kevin.	Janine
102101		Our next roadshow will be about that new movie we're preparing.	{name}
102102		No problem, but with Megastar Films keep disturbing us, I doubt it'll be a big success...	Tracy
102103		If Kevin is still the person I know, I think we should be fine.	{name}
102104		Well, we don't have better solutions anyway, so why not?	Tracy
102201		It worked! Our roadshow is finally the way it should be!	Tracy
102202		Yeah...	{name}
102203		What happened? You seem not happy about it.	Tracy
102204		Actually, I'm kind of feeling bad about the plan worked as I thought.	{name}
102301		This is the 10th city we covered. Remember the time when we founded our company and filmed our first movie, it feels just like yesterday.	{name}
102302		Yes, and we've overcomed many obstacles, especially now that Megastar Films stoped causing troubles for our roadshow.	Tracy
102303		Honestly, I had my doubts in the beginning. I didn't think of seeing this day coming so soon.	{actor}
102304		Well, we can't come this far without everyone's contribution to the company. Let's celebrate after our work here is done!	{name}
102401		May I ask something?	Janine
102402		You wanna know why I stoped messing with their roadshows. Do you remember the theme of their roadshow the last time?	Kevin
102403		If I remember it right, it's about a movie based on an actual  anti-narcotics operation?	Janine
102404		Correct. It is a successful operation, but not every agent lives to see the victory. At least, my son did not. {name} knows that too.	Kevin
102501		Things are pretty quiet these days...	{name}
102502		Haha, isn't it a good sign? Are you expecting some 'surprise'?	Tracy
102503		Surely not. Just hope this isn't the calm before the storm.	{name}
102601		Is this the list of all possible investors?	Kevin
102602		Yes. Unless they find ways to convince some total outsiders to make investment.	Janine
102603		I got a hold of {name}'s connections. As for that assistant girl, I don't see how she can be a threat. Just stick to this list.	Kevin
102604		No problem, sir.	Janine
102701		I'm willing to do anything for company as long it's within my range. But are you sure you want to do this, boss?	{actor}
102702		Attack is the best defense, isn't it? I don't want to just sit here worrying about Megastar's next move.	{name}
102703		Understood. How about Ms.Jones? Shall we let her know about this?	{actor}
102704		I 'll tell her when the time is right. As for now, it's safer to keep it between us.	{name}
102801		You suspect me for such a void reason? What can I get by doing this? Did you forget I worked with you ever since the day this conpany was founded?	{actor}
102802		Stop pretending! But you're right, you've been here too long. Maybe it's time for you to 'take a rest'.	{name}
102803		How dare you!	{actor}
102804		Wait! Calm down, both of you! What happened?	Tracy
102901		Oh, Look at today's headline-'Former Oskar winner, {name} publicly argue with their actor! Relationship broken?'	Janine
102902		Huh, they begun to lose their cool.	Kevin
102903		You think they are only putting on a show?	Janine
102904		A disappointing show... But beating them at their own game is not a bad idea.	Kevin
103001		So what's your answer? We truely hope you can join us at Megastar Films.	Janine
103002		If I agreed, it will only make me the person {name} falsely take me for.	{actor}
103003		But saying no to us wouldn't change it either. Be wise about it, you know clear that we can offer you more. Everyone should be responsible for their own future.	Janine
103004		...I need to think this over.	{actor}
103101		They're playing hard to get now, things are going with our script.	Janine
103102		Keep it that way. How's the other thing going?	Kevin
103103		So far so good. I'm already working on the details about the meeting with the listed investors.	Janine
103104		Good. Report to me after the preparation is all done.	Kevin
103201		Megastar Films is recruiting {actor}. Do you really think it's okay?	Tracy
103202		Actually, this is what I want to see. Our 'agruement' is intentional. I want {actor} to join them, as our spy.	{name}
103203		I see. But you could have told me first, I was really worried before.	Tracy
103204		Haha, sorry. But you know what they say, if you want to fool your enemy, you need to fool yourself first.	{name}
103301		Did you see the news today? Megastar Films has announced thier cooperation with {actor}.	Tracy
103302		Yes. Our contract with {First player} is still effective, they won't be able to reach official contract yet. (First player) also needs to earn their trust.	{name}
103303		With (actor)'s acting skills, I believe it's only a matter of time!	Tracy
103401		Now that {actor} is officially 'cooperating' with us, what shall we do next?	Janine
103402		We just let a chessman play its role.	Kevin
103403		Of course.	Janine
103501		Sorry, I didn't aquire much information by now.	{actor}
103502		No worries, it takes time for them to trust you.	{name}
103601		{name} seems still waiting for their 'messeger' to give them some clues.	Janine
103602		They'll never make it further if they keep being stupid like this.	Kevin
103603		That's good for us. They have no idea what we're actually doing.	Janine
103701		This meeting ends well.	Janine
103702		Sure. They have no reason to refuse.	Kevin
103703		{name}'s face should be really funny upon hearing the news.	Janine
103801		We've covered more than half cities in this country, this is inspiring!	{name}
103802		Yeah, I'm glad I made the right choice to join you!	Tracy
103803		Sorry to interupt, but I've got some disturbing news.	Rock Jones
103901		So that's what they've been doing.	{name}
103902		Yes. A friend of mine told me about their meeting with Kevin, the investors all agreed to stop funding us.	Rock Jones
103903		How could they?	Tracy
103904		It's reasonable. They'll own a favor from Kevin, which is valuable in this industry.	{name}
104001		We can cancel our 'Spy' plan now.	{name}
104002		Do you think Megastar Films found out already?	Tracy
104003		(Sigh) Not only found out. They used {actor} to attract our attention, so we won't notice what they're actually doing.	{name}
104101		{name} made up with {actor}, they must heard the news now.	Janine
104102		We'll just see what they'll do next.	Kevin
104201		Our financial situation maybe fine by now, but we won't be able to last long with no extra funds at all.	Tracy
104202		I know. That's why Kevin did this.	{name}
104301		You really gonna hold a party and invite all our investors, and Kevin?	Tracy
104302		Yes. Since they didn't make a public announcement yet, we still got a chance.	{name}
104303		But are you sure it's gonna work?	Tracy
104304		The key point is we get Kevin to show up at our party, everything else is based on it.	{name}
104401		{name} sent an invitation for you to their party, Mr.Kevin.	Janine
104402		I know what they're up to. I'll be helping them even by just showing up at the party.	Kevin
104403		So the answer is no. I'll make sure they got your reply.	Janine
104501		So, Kevin's not gonna coming to your party. What will you do now?	Janine
104502		Thought you should have more important things to do than delivering message like this.	{name}
104503		I do, but bad news need to be told in person, don't you agree?	Janine
104601		I'm not surprised that Kevin refused our invitation. What should we do now?	Tracy
104602		Guess I need to try my luck now…	{name}
104701		Hi Ms.Messager, would you mind to give my reply to Kevin in person too?	{name}
104702		Not at all. As long as your reply interests me.	Janine
104703		(Whispering…) Well, what do you think?	{name}
104704		Consider it done. I'm looking forward to see how this goes.	Janine
104801		{name} wants to meet with me in person? What makes they think I'll agree to it?	Kevin
104802		You might want to hear the location they chose. It's at…(Whispering...)	Janine
104803		I see…	Kevin
104901		You are close, aren't you? Or, used to be so close?	Tracy
104902		You mean Kevin and me?	{name}
104903		Yeah. I just feel you guys know each other so well. You are not just competitors, right?	Tracy
104904		Your feeling is right. Actually, Kevin made me the person I am today.	{name}
105001		You chose the place I wouldn't say no to. Now talk.	Kevin
105002		It's been 10 years, Kevin. Since the day my best friend-your son, was killed in that operation.	{name}
105003		So you just want to give him your regards at his grave?	Kevin
105004		He died before you have the chance to repair your relationship. But you still don't understand, even after all these years...	{name}
105101		What should I Understand? The fact that he refused all my arrangements for him to have a wonderful life, instead he got himself killed?	Kevin
105102		Is the arranged life truly wonderful for him? Kevin, he's not some character in your screenplay, he has his own thoughts and emotions. You can't just arrange him to live a life you want!	{name}
105103		He didn't mention to anyone that you're his father, but he's trying to prove to you that he can manage his own life. His death is a tragedy, but it's you who let him die with regrets!	{name}
105104		You are the best teacher I can ever hope to have. I know you're mad at me for quitting acting, but just like your son, I'm not a character whose fate is already written in the screenplay either.	{name}
105201		...Do what you want in the party. I won't interfere.	Kevin
105202		Thanks, Kevin! Come to the party as my most respectful teacher and competitor! I'll make you proud!	{name}
105203		Fine. Don't disappoint me.	Kevin
105301		How's your meeting with Kevin? Will he come to our party?	Tracy
105302		Relax, I've got it all under control.	{name}
105303		Now, let's get the party on!	{name}
200101		As the boss of our company, you need to pay close attention to our financial situation. We're lucky this time that our investors have faith in us and offered help, but we cannot count on our luck everytime.	Tracy
200102		Sure, I'm sorry. I'll be more careful in the future.	{name}
200201		How are you feeling, attending the Oskar ceremony again after all this time?	Tracy
200202		Well, next time I'm on that stage, will not be as an actor, but a producer!	{name}
200203		Haha, sure. But it's not easy to hold that trophy.	Tracy
200204		Of course, but that's what drives us to become better! After all, we need more trophies to climb the ranks!	{name}
200301		Look, that's  rewards for our movies filmed today!	Tracy
200302		Nice to see this after a day's hard work, haha.	{name}
200303		The better our box office is, the higher our rank is! Along with more rewards of course!	Tracy
200401		Looks pretty good actually! We're closer to the top than I thought we were.	Tracy
200402		Wow, I thought you had more faith in us than that.	{name}
200403		Oh I have plenty of faith! But with us being a new player on the block and all, I was a bit worried. Looks like I didn't need to be though. Let's keep it up!	Tracy
200501		Now we have our own Finance Department, we can exchange coins for moviedollars in emergency!	Tracy
200502		Great! We don't need to worry about lack of funds during movie filming process!	{name}
200503		Sure, but there is a time limit for exchange, so make sure we use it wisely!	Tracy
200504		Of course, I'm aware of that!	{name}
200601		We've received a 5 star screenplay! I can't wait to see what a success we can make out of it!	{name}
200602		Never thought the rank of screenplay would have such big influence upon movies…I always think the actor is the key of a movie's quality.	Tracy
200603		Haha, actors sure are important, but think of what a boost it'll be if we have both skilled actors and great screenplays!	{name}
200701		We've already signed contract, did you forget? But if you choose to sign with me again anyway, I'll give you my contract and other perks as gift!	{repeatactor}
200801		Now we can seek to reach a good deal with our business partners here!	{name}
200802		Negotiation is an important part of our business, make sure to choose your words wisely!	Tracy
200901		We have our own screenplay collection now, but there are still so many great screenplays out here!	Tracy
200902		Sure, we'll keep searching and add them to our collection!	{name}
201001		Business is war without bullets, we need to find ourself a reliable ally!	Tracy
201002		I agree. Let's list our candidates!	{name}
201101		Here we can view all the actors that are away right. Note that they can't be assigned to do any work in this condition.	Tracy
201102		I know, but we can still pay a small amount to call them back and be avaliable for work again!	{name}
201201		Take training lessons can improve our actors' attributes! But the training lessons are truly expensive…	Tracy
201202		Yeah, which requires us to be very careful about how to arrange these lessons.	{name}
201301		Now our actors can train their skills in this Training Room!	Tracy
201302		Good! Their skills can surely help imroving our movie's quality!	{name}
201401		We'll receive rewards from The United Movie Association every 10 levels!	Tracy
201402		That will surely be benefitting our company!	{name}
201501		We've rised to block rank 2! The United Movie Association has given us 5 trophies as reward!	Tracy
201502		Nice, now we're closer to next rank!	{name}
201601		Here are today's arrangements for you! Don't forget that we're following your example!	Tracy
201602		Of course! I'm a boss of my words.	{name}
